## About
---

Hyacinth is a bookmarking app that lets you group bookmarks into collection for ease of use! The inspiration behind this came from my own journey of learning to code and wishing I had a place where I could visually see groups of my most used sites and resources! :)

## Icebox

1. Redo the styling to make it look a bit more modern
2. Add edit functionality for bookmarks and the ability to copy them onto your clipboard!
